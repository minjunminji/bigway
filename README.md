# bigway
So basically there's this hot pot restaurant called Big Way, and the line up is always CRAZY.
You can't make reservations so you have to join a waitlist, which can take over 3 hours depending on when you join. I do NOT wanna wait in that line so I'm making a program that scrapes the waitlist website periodically and stores the data in a json file, which is provided to the front end where I can check what the estimated waitlist will be for the time that I want to go. That way, I can time my runs and not waste my time and spend more time scrolling!
Eventually I want to add a feature that also scrapes the average rate of going down the waitlist at different times, but I keep running into issues with waitlist join limits and whatnot.
